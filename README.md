### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="child">
      
        <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" class="qr-code">
        <div style="background: transparent;">
        <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>
```
```css
.child{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    flex-direction: column;
    background-color: white;
    width: 18vw;
    height: 30vw;
    border-radius: 18px;
    padding: 0 12px 15px 12px;
}
```




### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

For me it was very dificult to choose the right properties in css to get the body and the .card to work and be seen as the style guide declared.

At the end, i believe i did a good job with the things that i used.
Always open to any comments


```css
.body {
	background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
	font-size: 15px;
	font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	align-items: center;
	justify-content: center;
	margin: 4rem;
}

.card {
	background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
	box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
	border-radius: 0.625rem;
	width: 200px;
	padding: 0.9rem;
	margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

```

### Continued development

I would like to make my own QR Generator so this could be used as a default template.

The qr code could be links to a document or something along those ways. Going to think about something useful that could come in handy.

### Useful resources

- [FLEXBOX FROGGY](https://flexboxfroggy.com/#es) - This helped me to understand better how to use flexbox.

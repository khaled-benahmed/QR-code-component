## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

For me it was very dificult to choose the right properties in css to get the body and the .card to work and be seen as the style guide declared.

At the end, i believe i did a good job with the things that i used.

```css
.body {
	background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
	font-size: 15px;
	font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	align-items: center;
	justify-content: center;
	margin: 4rem;
}

.card {
	background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
	box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
	border-radius: 0.625rem;
	width: 200px;
	padding: 0.9rem;
	margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

```

### Useful resources

- [FLEXBOX FROGGY](https://flexboxfroggy.com/#es) - This helped me to understand better how to use flexbox.
